# Marlo
**Building the infra that gives agents experience.**

We build infrastructure for agent builders: trajectory capture, reward signals, and learning systems that make agents more reliable over time.

## What We Build
| Area | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| Trajectory capture | Full event trails for LLM calls, tool calls, and decisions. |
| Reward signals | Task‑level evaluation with clear rationales. |
| Learning loops | Shadow and active learnings to improve behavior safely. |
| Simulation + reports | Run different models on the same trajectory and compare results. |

## For Agent Builders
Marlo is for teams that already run agents and want:
- Better reliability and fewer failures
- Clear evidence for debugging and evaluation
- Learning that improves over time without changing your agent flow

## Repositories
Pinned repo show the docs how to use the SDK.
